# Methodology

## Input Data
The USTM Resiliency project uses many input data in order to effectively produce the output Destination Choice Logsum.

### Socioeconomic Data
Let's start by taking a look at the Socioeconomic data produced by the Utah Travel Study, conducted in 2012. This data summarizes information gathered from 10,000 randomly selected households in Utah. A small sampling is shown below:
```{r sedata, echo = FALSE}
sedata <- read.dbf("Data/SE_USTM_BASE2015.DBF")
kable(sedata[c(1200,3300,4500,5500,6000,7500,8000,8500),1:9],
      caption = "Random representation of available Socioeconomic Data")
```
In \@ref(tab:sedata) we can see the attributes associated with each of the households on record. Some of the geographic areas in Utah are associated with MPOs, as indicated in the SUBAREAID column. There are only 4 MPOs in Utah, so many households, such as those in Grand and Uintah counites, do not have TAZIDs associated with them. We will also look at a summary of this data set in \@ref(tab:sesum).
```{r sesum, echo = FALSE}
kable(summary(sedata),
      caption = "Summary of Socioeconomic Data")
```

### MC Constants and Coefficients
Lets also take a look at the Mode Choice Constants seen in Table \@ref(tab:mcconst) and the Mode Choice Coefficients in Table \@ref(tab:mccoeff) which are used to help weight the model inputs to correctly determine the Mode Choice Logsum, one of the outputs needed to correctly determine the Destination Choice Logsum. The Mode Choice Logsum eventually serves as the impedance term in the Destination Choice Logsum calculation, which is one of the reasons why it must be calculated. The Utah Statewide Model currently does not have the capability for destination choice modeling. To mitigate this, mode choice coefficients were adopted from both the Oregon Statewide Travel Model, and from the Roanoke Valley Transportation Planning Organization (RVTPO). The Oregon model had well suited data for each of the five trip types except Home-based Work trips, which led us to adopt coefficients from the RVTPO model for Home-based work trips. Calculating model coefficients is a lengthy and often expensive process. Thus, the needed coefficients were adopted from currently existing destination choice models. The acronyms used to describe the different trip types in the USTM model are as follows: HBW for Home-based work, HBO for Home-based other, NHB for Non-home based, HBC for Home-based college, and REC for Recreation related trips. 

```{r mcconst, echo = FALSE}
mcconst <- read.csv("Data/MC_Constants.csv")
kable(mcconst[1:4,],
      caption = "Mode Choice Constants")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:mcconst), K_SR indicates the constant for a shared ride for each of the trip purposes. Similarly, K_TRN indicates the constant for transit, K_NMOT indicates the constant for non-motorized, and K_PREM indicates the constant for premium (paid) services. Non-motorized transportation typically consists of individuals who either walk or bike to their destinations. Premium services consist of tranport options such as taxi, express busses (like the St. George Shuttle), or ride-sharing services such as UBER and Lyft.

```{r mccoeff, echo = FALSE}
mccoeff <- read.csv("Data/MC_Coefficients.csv")
kable(mccoeff,
      caption = "Mode Choice Coefficients")
```

Due to the fact that the Home-based Work (HBW) Mode Choice coefficients were adopted from a different model than the other coefficients, the values need to be examined to ensure that they are appropriate to be used alongside the coefficients from the Oregon Statewide Travel Model. A key to the coefficients included can be seen in  \@ref(fig:mccoeffkey) below.

```{r mccoeffkey, echo = FALSE}
mccoeffkey <- read.csv("Data/MC_Coefficients_Key.csv")
kable(mccoeffkey,
      caption = "Mode Choice Coefficients Key")
```

The coefficient for in-vehicle travel time is slightly smaller for HBW than for the other other trip purposes.

It is necessary to understand these variables and the purpose they serve, before examining the MC Utility Equations in the next section.

## Mode Choice Utility Equations

This section aims to analyze and explain the variables and terms included in the Mode Choice (MC) Utility Equation for each trip purpose. There will be some commonalities between each of the trip purposes, which will be noted in the explanation. The inputs in this section of the model are identical for each trip purpose. The inputs include a script file, which contains code specific to each trip purpose being examined, a processed skims matrix, the Peak-hour Transit skims (considered a constant in this model), and the Mode Choice Coefficients and Constants (as seen in \@ref(fig:mccoeff) and \@ref(fig:mcconst). The script file used to process the inputs controls which information is used to analyze each, thus allowing the same data inputs to be used for each trip purpose while only using the specific information pertaining to that trip purpose. The drive alone, non-motorized, and transit utilities are calculated for each trip purpose. The script files will be examined more closely in the following sections. Several output files are also prodiced for each fo the trip purposes. These include a print file, and matrix files that display the calculated probability and utility used in the logsum equation, as well as the calculated logsum values. 

### Home-based Work Mode Choice Utility Equation
The drive alone utility equation uses the coefficient of in-vehicle travel time, cost coefficient, and the autocost, along with the calculated travel time and distance between two zones. The equation appears as follows:
$$\begin{split} \text{ HBW_DRIVE_ALONE } = (\text{COEFF_IVTT * TIME)}\\ + (\text{COEFF_COST} * AUTOCOST * DISTANCE)\end{split}$$
The equation for HBW Non-motorized trips is:
$$\begin{split} \text{HBW_NMOT} = (\text{K_NMOT * COEFF_WALK1 * 20 * DISTANCE < 1 MILE)}\\+ (\text{COEFF_WALK2 * 20 * DISTANCE > 1 MILE})\end{split}$$

Similarly, the equation for HBW transit utility is as follows:
$$\begin{split}\text{HBW_TRANSIT} = (\text{K_TRN * WALK_BUS_TIME)}\\ + (\text{COEFF_COST} * AUTOCOST * DISTANCE)\end{split}$$

## Demonstration Model Framework

Figure \@ref(fig:modelfrmwrk) shows a schematic of the model framework as originally proposed. This framework closely matches that of existing destination choice models.

```{r modelfrmwrk, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(('images/model_framework.png'))
```


The framework has three main inputs:
A. Highway Network: The USTM model network was obtained from UDOT and forms the basis of the model.
B. Productions: Zonal trip productions from the USTM model  
C. Attractions: Zonal trip attractions from the USTM model
  
The model individually calculates mode choice and destination choice logsum values for each trip purpose, and then combines these outputs together. Thus, steps 3 and 4 of the model contain “children” processes with several groups of repeated code, once for each trip purpose. 

The mode choice model framework currently implemented is based on the Roanoke, Virginia travel model that serves as a basis for much of the code in the model. The USTM mode choice model uses similar alternatives and parameters, and we anticipate conflating and combining these coefficients in the next few weeks. The mode choice model includes utility parameters for in-vehicle travel time, out-of-vehicle travel time, wait time, automobile operating cost, and other elements for each trip purpose. The mode choice alternatives are drive alone, shared ride, non-motorized, and transit (all modes). USTM relies on MPO-level mode choice models to handle transit use, but in this application, it is important to consider transit as an available alternative. Work is underway to convert the minimum WFRC transit skim among all modes into a single “transit” skim at the USTM zone level.

The destination choice model uses the same purposes as the mode choice model, with utility equation coefficients including the zonal attractions as a size term and the mode choice log sum as an impedance term. The current demonstration model uses destination choice parameters and calibration constants derived from the Roanoke, Virginia model. Research into destination choice utility coefficients used in statewide models is ongoing, and a minimal calibration exercise will be reported at the next TAC meeting.

The outputs are then combined to create a single file with all of the destination choice log sum accessibility outputs. The final output of the model is the destination choice log sum, shown as an individual rowsum for each trip purpose. 

## Simulating a Broken Link Within the Demonstration Model
We conducted a sensitivity analysis where we simulated a broken highway link in our demonstration model to verify that the model was responding in an appropriate way. Figure 4 shows the change in the log sum value for each purpose resulting from breaking a single highway link across all trip purposes. In order to simulate the changes caused by a broken link, a link was removed from the network file; the model then uses updated highway travel times to compute the mode and destination choice log sums. In general, the change in log sums shows a reasonable response, but the link selected is a major facility for travel in all directions through Roanoke. We are currently investigating whether these unexpected results are the result of improper specification, or whether they reveal a genuine nuance within this particular application technique.

## Identifying Vulnerable Links
It is necessary for us to identify links in the UTSM network whose breaks we could simulate in our analysis. The AEM (2017) study inspiring this current work identified nine physical threat categories and locations of elevated risk to highway facilities on the I-15 corridor; the present analysis requires that we identify highway links at risk anywhere in Utah, and thus cannot rely only on the identification completed by AEM. An alternative method to identifying links vulnerable to specific risks would be to simply make arbitrary cuts in the network at locations the TAC identifies that could be representative of unknown threats or suspected choke points in the USTM network. The Risk Priority Analysis completed by BIO-WEST (2020) shows Composite Threat Probability by Road Segment. We used this analysis to identify 40 locations in the UTSM network that are either posed with an elevated annual threat or identified as a choke point. We also desired to have a mix of urban and rural facilities to demonstrate the potential flexibility of our proposed technique.
