Many hazards (both manmade and naturally occurring) exist that threaten the integrity of these systems. Much is already known about the effects disasters can have on transportation systems, such as changes in route choice, travel time, and transit ridership. Recent disasters, such as the Minneapolis Bridge Collapse and the Atlanta Bridge Fire, have given researchers the opportunity to better evaluate these changes in recent years. Researchers employed numerous methods to analyze and understand the regional impacts of these events. However, one tool that is not well represented in current research is traffic forecasting and planning software. Programs such as Citilabs’ CUBE possess unique capabilies to analyze more types of data all at once through logit modeling, rather than separately as has been done in existing research. This project seeks to determine if logit modeling can better predict the impacts of adverse effects on transportation systems by using socioeconomic data gathered during the 2010 US Census to forecast changes in destination choice. It is hypothesized that by comparing changes in forecasted travel between transportation analysis zones (TAZs), a better prediction of the changes to driver behavior, and thus destination choice, can be made. ## Warning: package &#39;xtable&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.2 ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ✓ tibble 3.0.3 ✓ dplyr 1.0.1 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.1 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 1.3.1 ✓ forcats 0.5.0 ## Warning: package &#39;ggplot2&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 ## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 ## Warning: package &#39;tidyr&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 ## Warning: package &#39;dplyr&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## Warning: package &#39;pander&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 ## Warning: package &#39;knitr&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 "],
["literature-review.html", "Chapter 2 Literature Review 2.1 Identifying Critical Links on I-15 2.2 Network Connectivity 2.3 Changes in Travel Time 2.4 Changes in Accessibility 2.5 Summary", " Chapter 2 Literature Review The resilience and connectivity of transport networks are a long-studied topic within transportation engineering in both theoretical and practical contexts. Within this long history however, there is variability in how scholars define resiliency. There are three basic definitions that researchers have used: Resilience through Resistance: Resilient transportation networks have few and manageable vulnerabilities. This is typically addressed through robust facility-level engineering and risk management (e.g., Bradley, 2007). Resilience through Recovery: Resilient transportation networks are able to be repaired and returned to normal service without inordinate delay. This is accomplished through effective resource allocation and incident management (e.g., Zhang and Wang, 2016). Resilience through Operability in Crisis: Resilient transport networks are able to operate effectively with damaged or unusable links. It is this definition that is most relevant in the context of this study. These definitions are not entirely mutually exclusive, and many researchers apply more than one definition in their work. The motivation of this research is to identify systemically critical facilities, and therefore we primarily consider literature using the third definition. We begin this review first by examining the study conducted by AEM on behalf of UDOT to identify vulnerable sections on the I-15 corridor. We then consider previous attempts in the academic literature to evaluate real and fabricated transportation networks. 2.1 Identifying Critical Links on I-15 AEM worked with UDOT to put together a team of individuals to develop an I-15 Corridor Risk and Resilience (R&amp;R) Pilot in 2017. This project had a seven-step plan to understand the impact of physical threats to the Utah transportation network, specifically looking at two sections along I-15. These steps include asset characterization, threat characterization, consequence analysis, vulnerability assessment, threat assessment, risk/resilience assessment, and risk/resilience management. From these steps AEM was able to provide recommendations to UDOT that would improve resiliency along the corridor based on the criticality of each segment at risk. AEM’s analysis consisted of: gathering characteristic data for each asset (length, width, depth, condition, etc.), determining a replacement cost for each asset, establishing an estimated service life for each asset, estimating (if not known) the design standard for each asset, establishing which magnitudes of each threat were to be analyzed, and gathering information on the likelihood of occurrence of each magnitude of each threat. These steps are further described in their paper using multiple different threat locations. The AEM R&amp;R report provides a good template going forward for identifying links at risk, following the first definition of a resilient transportation network. The report also attempts to identify which links at risk are most critical, assessing a “criticality” score to the network based on the five data elements and categories given in Table 2.1. A key observation of these criticality scores is that they do not accommodate alternate routes that the traffic could use were the link to become unavailable. In identifying the systemic resiliency of highway facilities – as implied by the third definition of resiliency – requires considering these alternate routes. Table 2.1: AEM Criticality Score Assignment Criteria AADT Truck AADT AASHTO Roadway Classification Tourism Traffic Maintenance Crew 2.1.1 Attempts to Evaluate Systemic Resiliency A number of researchers have conducted studies where they construct real or fabricated transportation networks, eliminate or degrade links in the network, and evaluate the changes the loss of these links introduced into some measure of network performance. Berdica (2002) attempts to identify, define and conceptualize vulnerability by envisioning analyses conducted with several vulnerability performance measures including travel time, delay, congestion, serviceability and accessibility. Here, Berdica defines accessibility as the ability for users to travel between origins and destinations for any number of reasons. She then uses the performance measures to define vulnerability as the level of reduced accessibility due to unfavorable operating conditions on the network. In particular, Berdica identifies a need for further research toward developing a framework capable of investigating reliability of transportation networks. In this section we will examine several attempts by numerous researchers to do precisely this using different measures of network performance. A consolidation of this discussion is summarized in Table 2, namely the methods that different researchers have used in examining network performance under duress. The measures can be consolidated in to three basic families: A. Network Connectivity considers how isolated nodes of a network become when links are damaged. B. Travel Time analysis considers how removing or degrading a link affects the shortest cost paths between network points. C. Accessibility analysis considers how the population using the network has their daily patterns affected by the damaged network. We discuss studies within each family in turn. Table 2.

Network connectivity 2019 Hackl and Adey Network connectivity 2.2 Network Connectivity Graph theory is the mathematical study of networks of nodes connected by edges (links). Within this discipline are the related concepts of network vulnerability and connectivity that have been accessed by researchers. In these studies, researchers tend to define critical links as those that connect to many other nodes (directly or indirectly), or as links whose loss isolates a number of nodes from the rest of the network. Abdel-Rahim et al., (2007) explores multi-layered graph theory to attempt to asses transportation network criticality. The researchers develop a weighting scheme based on interconnectedness between three layers of the transportation system: the power, communication, and physical road networks. This scheme is applied to and combined with data gathered using an Origin-destination matrix to determine criticality of road network facilities based on several proximity and link and node volume criteria. Abdel-Rahim et al. attempts to determine resilience through resistance by identifying a metric for examining the interrelatedness of the three systems, all of which are vital to proper function of the transportation network. Their methodology highlights some of the advantages to using a multi-layered graph approach for determining levels of resiliency of transportation networks. Similarly, Ip and Wang (2011), attempt to combine graph theory with friability in order to determine criticality of links or hub cities. Friability is defined as the reduction of network capacity caused by removing a link or node. The methodology presented relies on the ability to determine the weighted sum of the resilience of all nodes based on the weighted average of connectedness with other city nodes in the network. The authors determine that the recovery of transportability between two cities largely depends on redundant links between nodes. Ip and Wang also comment that most traffic managers are more concerned with the friability of single links rather than the friability of multiple links or an entire system. The author’s hypothesis closely matches resilience through operability because the methodology seeks to determine resilience of a network that already has damaged links and nodes. Their main contribution to the field of transportation research is the idea of friability, that a network can break down for any number of reasons, of which transportation networks generally appear most susceptible to attack or disaster. Another researcher uses graph theory to approach the optimization of transportation systems. Zhang et al. (2015) investigates the role of network topology, meaning the layout of the network. The authors provide several examples of network topology types including hub and spoke, grid, and ring networks. After computing resilience indexes, or general resilience levels of each type of network topology, Zhang determines that metrics such as throughput, connectivity and average reciprocal distance increase with greater linage, however they decrease as networks become larger. This is likely because larger networks are sparser, having fewer node connections, and therefore are less redundant. Allowing for preparedness measures helped increase levels of resiliency. The authors greatest contribution appears to be increased understanding of the role network size and type plays in determining resiliency. Understanding how interconnectedness increases or decreases resiliency is vital to traffic managers. Hackl and Adey (2019) show the abilities of a Networks in Networks (NIN) approach, where nodes in a network represent other networks. Their methodology allows multiple types of data including topology, paths, and origin-destination data to be loaded into the same graph style network. The researchers prepare an example NIN with four layers. The NIN is able to effectively demonstrate changes to traffic flow. Some are unable to occur due to interrupted edges on the network. This form of network representation is effective for simplifying highly connected networks. The contribution of NIN networks is highly interesting, and should be investigated further to help aid in the reduction of time needed to locate critical infrastructure on transportation networks. 2.3 Changes in Travel Time Graph theoretical approaches to resiliency largely consider whether the network nodes become isolated after links are degraded or removed. Though isolation is an important problem, transportation networks often have multiple redundant paths between nodes; however, some of these paths may be considerably longer. It is therefore useful to determine how the path cost changes even if the nodes involved are still reachable on the network. Peeta et al. (2010) constructs a model to evaluate the most efficient allocation of highway maintenance resources prior to an earthquake with the potential to disrupt transport network connectivity. The authors create a simplified graph of Istanbul, Turkey with 30 attributed links and 25 nodes, with each link having a specified failure probability that could be mitigated with investment. Using this graph, the researchers evaluate what happened to travel times between the origin-destination pairs as links from this network were disabled using a Monte Carlo simulation. The authors showed that this problem is tractable with a locally optimal solution existing. Ibrahim (2011) provides an alternative heuristic approach for determining vulnerability of infrastructure by estimating the cost of single link failure based on the increase in shortest path travel time due to increased congestion levels. Ibrahim proposes a hybrid heuristic approach that calculates the traditional user-equilibrium assignment for finding the first set of costs, and then fixes those costs for all following iterations to determine the effects of failure on overall travel time of the system. Ibrahim’s novel heuristic approach is important because of its ability to drastically reduce computation time for larger networks while providing accurate results that closely match results found from traditional modeling methods. Omer et al. (2013) proposes a methodology for assessing the resiliency of physical infrastructure during disruptions. To do this, the authors use a network model to build an origin-destination matrix that allows initial network loading and analysis. Omer’s model uses several metrics, but the main metric used to determine resiliency is the difference in travel time between a disturbed and undisturbed network. Omer’s framework is applied to an actual network between New York City and Boston for analysis. Changes in demand, travel time, mode choice and route choice are tracked for analysis. Omer’s framework supports operability of transportation networks due to the way it analyzes networks experiencing suboptimal circumstances. The authors work identifies key parameters that should be measured to assess resiliency during disruptive events. Jaller et al. (2015) seeks to identify critical infrastructure based on increased travel time, or reduced capacity due to disaster. The proposed methodology utilizes user-equilibrium to determine proper initial network loading. Then, the shortest path between one origin and one destination can be identified. To implement damage to the network, a link is cut, and then the next shortest path is found. This process is followed for all links in the system in order to determine a sense of the criticality of each link to network resiliency. The analysis is carried out for each O-D pair, and the nodes with greatest change in travel time are determined to be the most critical. Jaller’s methodology allows traffic managers to identify critical paths for mitigation purposes before the occurrence of disaster through careful analysis. 2.4 Changes in Accessibility Accessibility refers to the ease with which individuals can reach the destinations that matter to them; this is an abstract idea but one that has been quantified in numerous ways. Dong et al., (2006) provides a helpful framework for understanding various quantitative definitions of accessibility that we will simplify here. The most elementary definition of accessibility is whether a destination is within an isochrone, or certain distance. This measure is often represented as a count, e.g., the number of jobs reachable from a particular location within thirty minutes travel time by a particular mode. Mathematically, \\(A_i=\\sum_j X_j I_{ij}\\) ,where \\(I_{ij} = 1\\) if \\(d_{ij} &lt; D\\) and \\(I_{ij}=0\\) if $d_{ij} &gt; D $ where the accessibility A at point i is the sum of the all the jobs or other destinations X at other points j. \\(I_{ij}\\) is an indicator function equal to zero if the distance between the points \\(d_{ij}\\) is less than some asserted threshold (e.g., thirty minutes of travel time). By relaxing the assumption of a binary isochrone and instead using the distance directly, we can derive the so-called gravity model, \\(A_i=\\sum_j X_j f(d_{ij})\\) where the function \\(f(d_{ij)}\\) is often a negative exponential with a calibrated impedance coefficient. An extension of the gravity model is to use the logsum term of a multinomial logit destination choice model, \\(A_i=ln\\sum_j β_d d_{ij} + X_j β\\) Where the parameters β are estimated from choice surveys or calibrated to observed data. The logsum term has numerous benefits outlined by Handy and Niemeier (1997) and Dong et al. (2007); namely, the measure is based in actual choice theory, and can include multiple destination types and travel times by multiple different modes. Accessibility measures of any kind are important in resiliency analysis because a damaged transport network will limit the ability of people to access the full variety of destinations they otherwise would. Guers and van Wee (2004) provide a review of accessibility measures such as those above up to 2004. Of the papers they reviewed, Vickerman (1974), Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1979), Geurs and Ritsema van Eck (2001) used isochrone type methods, Stewart (1947), Hansen (1959), Ingram (1971), and Vickerman (1971), and Anas (1983) used gravity, and Neuburger (1971), Leonardi (1987), Williams and Senior (1978), Koenig( 1980), Anas (1983), Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985), Sweet (1997), Niemier (1997), Handy and Niemier (1997), Levine (1998), and Miller (1999) used or suggested logsums. They highlight the importance of using person-based measures such as these in evaluating network vulnerability and resiliency. Taylor (2008) also examines accessibility as a way to analyze network vulnerabilities, mainly through logsum analysis. Taylor begins by explaining the concepts of vulnerability and accessibility, which further help to explain their interrelatedness and key distinctions. He then applies logsum analysis to provide a framework for solving problems of accessibility. Taylor’s method for identifying vulnerabilities involves modeling travel demand, network topology, capacity, and road geometry in a manner that closely resembles a graph network. He does make one key distinction between links and nodes, however. A Node is vulnerable if link loss to that node diminishes its accessibility, while a Link is critical if its loss significantly diminishes accessibility within the network. One drawback to Taylor’s methodology at this point, is that it is intended to be used after critical locations have been identified. Ganin et al. (2017) attempts to investigate resiliency through a disruption of 5% of the roadways in 40 urban networks within the United States. The employed methodology determines that Salt Lake City has the most resilient transportation network while Washington D.C. has the least resilient. This determination is based on a comparison of the network after links are damaged versus before. The authors work three factors into each model, namely the proportionality coefficient, minimum speed, and vehicle size adjustment factors. These essentially account for differences in car-truck ratios, average speed, and average vehicle length. Using a gravity model—a model which accounts for attraction and distance between zones—the authors were able to estimate the average annual delay per commuter. They used this to determine network efficiency. Ganin noted that traffic delay times increase significantly as road segments are broken. The main benefit from this article is the use of a gravity model to determine ways in which accurate transportation models can be calculated. 2.5 Summary The lessons learned from the events in Minneapolis and Atlanta demonstrate that when transportation networks are damaged or degraded by link failure, multiple changes result. Traffic diverts to other facilities and other modes, and some people make fundamental changes to their daily activity patterns, choosing new destinations or eliminating trips entirely. Numerous other researchers have identified methodologies to capture the effects, or at least the costs, of these potential changes in modeled crisis events. We are able to learn from these methodologies to create a methodology on a state-wide level. ## Warning: package &#39;foreign&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 "],

These inputs are taken from the Oregen Statewide Travel Model, and from the Roanokoke Valley Transportation Planning Organization. The Oregon model had well suited data for each of the five trip types except Home-based work trips, which is why we used the RVTPO data for HBW trip purposes. 3.2 Demonstration Model Framework Figure 1 shows a schematic of the model framework. include_graphics(rep(&#39;images/model_framework.png&#39;, 3)) The framework has three main inputs: A. Highway Network: The USTM model network was obtained from UDOT and forms the basis of the model. B. Productions: Zonal trip productions from the USTM model C. Attractions: Zonal trip attractions from the USTM model The model individually calculates mode choice and destination choice logsum values for each trip purpose, and then combines these outputs together. Thus, steps 3 and 4 of the model contain “children” processes with several groups of repeated code, once for each trip purpose. The mode choice model framework currently implemented is based on the Roanoke, Virginia travel model that serves as a basis for much of the code in the model. The USTM mode choice model uses similar alternatives and parameters, and we anticipate conflating and combining these coefficients in the next few weeks. The mode choice model includes utility parameters for in-vehicle travel time, out-of-vehicle travel time, wait time, automobile operating cost, and other elements for each trip purpose. The mode choice alternatives are drive alone, shared ride, non-motorized, and transit (all modes). USTM relies on MPO-level mode choice models to handle transit use, but in this application, it is important to consider transit as an available alternative. Work is underway to convert the minimum WFRC transit skim among all modes into a single “transit” skim at the USTM zone level. The destination choice model uses the same purposes as the mode choice model, with utility equation coefficients including the zonal attractions as a size term and the mode choice log sum as an impedance term. The current demonstration model uses destination choice parameters and calibration constants derived from the Roanoke, Virginia model. Research into destination choice utility coefficients used in statewide models is ongoing, and a minimal calibration exercise will be reported at the next TAC meeting. The outputs are then combined to create a single file with all of the destination choice log sum accessibility outputs. The final output of the model is the destination choice log sum, shown as an individual rowsum for each trip purpose. 3.3 Simulating a Broken Link Within the Demonstration Model We conducted a sensitivity analysis where we simulated a broken highway link in our demonstration model to verify that the model was responding in an appropriate way. Figure 4 shows the change in the log sum value for each purpose resulting from breaking a single highway link across all trip purposes. In order to simulate the changes caused by a broken link, a link was removed from the network file; the model then uses updated highway travel times to compute the mode and destination choice log sums. In general, the change in log sums shows a reasonable response, but the link selected is a major facility for travel in all directions through Roanoke. We are currently investigating whether these unexpected results are the result of improper specification, or whether they reveal a genuine nuance within this particular application technique. include_graphics(rep(&#39;images/absolute_error_choropleth&#39;, 3)) 3.4 Identifying Vulnerable Links It is necessary for us to identify links in the UTSM network whose breaks we could simulate in our analysis. The AEM (2017) study inspiring this current work identified nine physical threat categories and locations of elevated risk to highway facilities on the I-15 corridor; the present analysis requires that we identify highway links at risk anywhere in Utah, and thus cannot rely only on the identification completed by AEM. An alternative method to identifying links vulnerable to specific risks would be to simply make arbitrary cuts in the network at locations the TAC identifies that could be representative of unknown threats or suspected choke points in the USTM network. The Risk Priority Analysis completed by BIO-WEST (2020) shows Composite Threat Probability by Road Segment. We used this analysis to identify 40 locations in the UTSM network that are either posed with an elevated annual threat or identified as a choke point. We also desired to have a mix of urban and rural facilities to demonstrate the potential flexibility of our proposed technique. include_graphics(rep(&#39;images/risky_links.png&#39;, 3)) "],

["references-1.html", "References", " References In the following DCLS analysis and comparison between an original, fully functioning network and a broken network, one intersection was removed from the network, meaning no vehicles could traverse the area as usual. The intersection of Melrose Ave and Peters Creek Rd. Both links appear to be major routes, with 2 lanes traveling in all directions, and a signalized intersection used for traffic control. The intersections is surrounded by small businesses and a small shopping complex, that appears to be in the style of a strip mall, and there are neighborhoods in the vicinity. The input data included in this analysis are both the whole and altered network DCLS outputs, as well as a shapefile map of the Roanoke, VA, area. The model was initially run on this dummy network because it is much smaller (with 267 TAZ’s, compared to USTM’s 8700 TAZ’s) and can run a full analysis from beginning to end in about 20-30 seconds. This allows the model to be created quickly, because bugs can be found more effectively. # Loading two data sets and a base map from the data folder # The first data set is the whole network named WHOLE_ROWSUMS.DBF # The second data set is 01_ROWSUMS.DBF, which should be taken # from the CUBE model each time a new iteration is run whole_rowsum &lt;- read.dbf(&quot;Data/WHOLE_ROWSUMS.DBF&quot;) #original unbroken network broken_rowsum &lt;- read.dbf(&quot;Data/01_ROWSUMS.DBF&quot;) #altered broken network map &lt;- st_read(&quot;Data/RoanokeTAZ.shp&quot;) #load shapefile An initial difference comparison was run on the data to determine the number of changes, if any, that were produced by cutting a link in the model. For this comparison, there are 312 differences between the original data set and the new data with a cut link. Lets compare several different methods to visualize the differences in DCLS created by the model because there were several hundred differences. Visualizing the data will help to better understand some of the impacts that a reduction in network function can have on the immediate and distant vicinity of the network disruption. In the following plots, we see several different sets of code and outputs that compare the original functional network to a network with a cut link. Each plot shows a measure of the differences using a different mathematical comparison. A brief commentary, which will highlight changes between plots, if any, will be provided. An additional summary of total RMSE calculations will also be provided. . # Create plot that compares the before and after 5 trip purposes using # a simple difference calculation change_broken1 &lt;- list( &quot;Original&quot; = whole_rowsum, &quot;Broken Link&quot; = broken_rowsum ) %&gt;% bind_rows(.id = &quot;Scenario&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% gather(&quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;logsum&quot;, -Scenario, -TAZ) %&gt;% spread(Scenario, logsum, fill = NA) %&gt;% mutate( difference = (`Broken Link` - Original) ) %&gt;% select(TAZ, purpose, difference) %&gt;% spread(purpose, difference, NA) # Stitching data together broken_map &lt;- left_join(map, change_broken1, by = c(&quot;ID&quot; = &quot;TAZ&quot;)) # Create choropleth with 5 trip purposes plot(broken_map[, c(&quot;LNHBO&quot;, &quot;LNHBW&quot;, &quot;LNREC&quot;, &quot;LNHBC&quot;, &quot;LNNHB&quot;)]) The differences between the simple difference plot and the absolute error plot are that all values must be positive in the absolute error comparison. This simply changes the color scheme of the output plots. Coincidentally, this makes it easier to interpret the plots visually. This is a useful change to the information. # Create plot that compares the before and after 5 trip purposes using # an absolute error calculation change_broken2 &lt;- list( &quot;Original&quot; = whole_rowsum, &quot;Broken Link&quot; = broken_rowsum ) %&gt;% bind_rows(.id = &quot;Scenario&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% gather(&quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;logsum&quot;, -Scenario, -TAZ) %&gt;% spread(Scenario, logsum, fill = NA) %&gt;% mutate( difference = (abs(`Broken Link` - Original)) ) %&gt;% select(TAZ, purpose, difference) %&gt;% spread(purpose, difference, NA) # Stitching data together broken_map &lt;- left_join(map, change_broken2, by = c(&quot;ID&quot; = &quot;TAZ&quot;)) # Create choropleth with 5 trip purposes plot(broken_map[, c(&quot;LNHBO&quot;, &quot;LNHBW&quot;, &quot;LNREC&quot;, &quot;LNHBC&quot;, &quot;LNNHB&quot;)]) The next two plots show the results using an RMSE and mean absolute error calculation (MAE). MAE measures the average magnitude of the error in a data set, without considering direction. The MAE plot shows the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all observations are weighted equally. The RMSE function is valuable because of the quadratic nature with which it measures the average magnitude of error in the data. RMSE shows the square root of the average squared difference between estimated and actual data. # Create plot that compares the before and after 5 trip purposes using # an RMSE calculation change_broken3 &lt;- list( &quot;Original&quot; = whole_rowsum, &quot;Broken Link&quot; = broken_rowsum ) %&gt;% bind_rows(.id = &quot;Scenario&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% gather(&quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;logsum&quot;, -Scenario, -TAZ) %&gt;% spread(Scenario, logsum, fill = NA) %&gt;% mutate( difference = sqrt(((Original - `Broken Link`)^2)/nrow(whole_rowsum)) ) %&gt;% select(TAZ, purpose, difference) %&gt;% spread(purpose, difference, NA) # Stitching data together broken_map &lt;- left_join(map, change_broken3, by = c(&quot;ID&quot; = &quot;TAZ&quot;)) # Create choropleth with 5 trip purposes plot(broken_map[, c(&quot;LNHBO&quot;, &quot;LNHBW&quot;, &quot;LNREC&quot;, &quot;LNHBC&quot;, &quot;LNNHB&quot;)]) # Create plot that compares the before and after 5 trip purposes using # an MAE calculation change_broken4 &lt;- list( &quot;Original&quot; = whole_rowsum, &quot;Broken Link&quot; = broken_rowsum ) %&gt;% bind_rows(.id = &quot;Scenario&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% gather(&quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;logsum&quot;, -Scenario, -TAZ) %&gt;% spread(Scenario, logsum, fill = NA) %&gt;% mutate( difference = (abs(`Broken Link` - Original)/nrow(whole_rowsum)) ) %&gt;% select(TAZ, purpose, difference) %&gt;% spread(purpose, difference, NA) # Stitching data together broken_map &lt;- left_join(map, change_broken4, by = c(&quot;ID&quot; = &quot;TAZ&quot;)) # Create choropleth with 5 trip purposes plot(broken_map[, c(&quot;LNHBO&quot;, &quot;LNHBW&quot;, &quot;LNREC&quot;, &quot;LNHBC&quot;, &quot;LNNHB&quot;)]) Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of the prediction accuracy used in statistical analysis. MAPE is typically used as a loss function in regression analysis and in model evaluation. This is because it is good at interpreting relative error. The MAPE plot, when compared with the MAE plot, shows more variation in change measurement. That is, it provides what appears to be a more detailed plot with increased color variations. This can specifically be seen to the south of the city center area. One drawback to using MAPE, is that all calculations are weighted equally, so there is no way to differentiate between important and unimportant. # Create plot that compares the before and after 5 trip purposes using # an mean absolute percentage calculation change_broken5 &lt;- list( &quot;Original&quot; = whole_rowsum, &quot;Broken Link&quot; = broken_rowsum ) %&gt;% bind_rows(.id = &quot;Scenario&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% gather(&quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;logsum&quot;, -Scenario, -TAZ) %&gt;% spread(Scenario, logsum, fill = NA) %&gt;% mutate( difference = (abs((Original - `Broken Link`)/`Broken Link`))*(1/nrow(whole_rowsum)) ) %&gt;% select(TAZ, purpose, difference) %&gt;% spread(purpose, difference, NA) # Stitching data together broken_map &lt;- left_join(map, change_broken5, by = c(&quot;ID&quot; = &quot;TAZ&quot;)) # Create choropleth with 5 trip purposes plot(broken_map[, c(&quot;LNHBO&quot;, &quot;LNHBW&quot;, &quot;LNREC&quot;, &quot;LNHBC&quot;, &quot;LNNHB&quot;)]) Now that we have reviewed all the different ways to measure the differences between the original and altered network destination choice logusms, we will view the overall RMSE value for each trip purpose from each of the comparisons. ## Total RMSE between full model and difference comparison RMSE(change_broken1, parameter = whole_rowsum, type = &quot;RMSE&quot;) ## TAZ LNHBC LNHBO LNHBW LNNHB LNREC ## 157.32682 64.12083 64.47364 62.64110 63.06791 63.41272 ## Total RMSE between full model and absolute error comparison RMSE(change_broken2, parameter = whole_rowsum, type = &quot;RMSE&quot;) ## TAZ LNHBC LNHBO LNHBW LNNHB LNREC ## 157.32682 64.11984 64.47250 62.63952 63.06703 63.41139 ## Total RMSE between full model and RMSE comparison RMSE(change_broken3, parameter = whole_rowsum, type = &quot;RMSE&quot;) ## TAZ LNHBC LNHBO LNHBW LNNHB LNREC ## 157.32682 64.12030 64.47303 62.71922 63.06743 63.41201 ## Total RMSE between full model and mean absolute error comparison RMSE(change_broken4, parameter = whole_rowsum, type = &quot;RMSE&quot;) ## TAZ LNHBC LNHBO LNHBW LNNHB LNREC ## 157.32682 64.12033 64.47306 62.72413 63.06746 63.41205 ## Total RMSE between full model and mean absolute percentage comparison RMSE(change_broken5, parameter = whole_rowsum, type = &quot;RMSE&quot;) ## TAZ LNHBC LNHBO LNHBW LNNHB LNREC ## 157.32682 64.12033 64.47307 62.72442 63.06746 63.41205 From the RMSE calculation results, we can see that each of the previous methods used to determine differences between the orignal data and the altered data vary slightly. For example, in the LNHBC term, the RMSE values differ slightly, ranging from 64.11984 to 64.12083, with absolute error returning a smaller value than each of the other methods, and the simple difference comparison returning a larger value. Interestingly, for LNHBC, the MAE and MAPE are identical at 64.12033. Similar trends follow for LNHBO, LNHB, and LNREC. LNHBW has a smallest overall RMSE value when absolute error is used, and a largest overall RMSE value when MAPE is used. The values for LNHBW range from 62.6392 to 62.72442. LNNHB similarly reports a lowest overall RMSE value when absolute error is used, however, the reported largest overall RMSE value is the same for MAE and MAPE, with a range from 63.06703 to 63.06791. LNHBC has an overall RMSE range of 9.910^{-4}, LNHBO has a range of just 0.00114, LNHBW a range of 0.0849, LNNHB a range of 8.810^{-4}, and LNREC a range of 0.00133. The trip purpose with the smallest overall RMSE range is LNHBC, while LNHBW has the highest RMSE range with 0.0849. THis indicates that LNHBW is the tirp purpose most negatively effected by the link break done for this analysis, as reported previously. LNHBC was the trip purpsoe with the highest level of resilience for this particular scenario. "]
