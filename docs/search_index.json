Many hazards (both manmade and naturally occurring) exist that threaten the integrity of these systems. Much is already known about the effects disasters can have on transportation systems, such as changes in route choice, travel time, and transit ridership. Recent disasters, such as the Minneapolis Bridge Collapse and the Atlanta Bridge Fire, have given researchers the opportunity to better evaluate these changes in recent years. Researchers employed numerous methods to analyze and understand the regional impacts of these events. However, one tool that is not well represented in current research is traffic forecasting and planning software. Programs such as Citilabs’ CUBE possess unique capabilies to analyze more types of data all at once through logit modeling, rather than separately as has been done in existing research. This project seeks to determine if logit modeling can better predict the impacts of adverse effects on transportation systems by using socioeconomic data gathered during the 2010 US Census to forecast changes in destination choice. It is hypothesized that by comparing changes in forecasted travel between transportation analysis zones (TAZs), a better prediction of the changes to driver behavior, and thus destination choice, can be made.

["literature-review.html", "Chapter 3 Literature Review 3.1 Overview 3.2 Lessons Learned from Crisis Events", " Chapter 3 Literature Review Here is a review of existing methods: 3.1 Overview The resilience and connectivity of transport networks are a long-studied topic within transportation engineering in both theoretical and practical contexts. Within this long history however, there is variability in how scholars define resiliency. There are three basic definitions that researchers have used: Resilience through Resistance: Resilient transportation networks have few and manageable vulnerabilities. This is typically addressed through robust facility-level engineering and risk management (e.g., Bradley, 2007). Resilience through Recovery: Resilient transportation networks are able to be repaired and returned to normal service without inordinate delay. This is accomplished through effective resource allocation and incident management (e.g., Zhang and Wang, 2016). Resilience through Operability in Crisis: Resilient transport networks are able to operate effectively with damaged or unusable links. It is this definition that is most relevant in the context of this study. These definitions are not entirely mutually exclusive, and many researchers apply more than one definition in their work. For example, knowing where systemically critical or vulnerable links are will help in allocating maintenance resources. At the same time, the approach to identifying critical facilities implied by one of these definitions is not always compatible with the other definitions and making distinctions between them is important (Rogers et al, 2012). A bridge highly vulnerable to failure may be located on a little-traveled and systemically unimportant side street. The motivation of this research is to identify systemically critical facilities, and therefore we primarily consider literature using the third definition. Professionals seem to have adopted use of the Four R’s as a means to predict some form of resilience. The Four R’s include: rapidity, redundancy, robustness, and resourcefulness. Here, rapidity is inversely related to the closure time and is used to measure how quickly a road can recover from a setback. Redundancy can be measured by the additional time or distance a user has to travel when a route is broken. Greater amounts of time or distance lower the overall redundancy. Robustness is the inverse of risk, and represents the overall strength of the system as a whole. Resourcefulness, the last of the Four R’s, is the ability to find quick solutions in a network. An attempt will be made to identify the first time that these terms surface in the reviewed literature. We begin this review first by examining the study conducted by AEM on behalf of UDOT to identify vulnerable sections on the I-15 corridor. We then consider observations learned from systemic changes to networks and populations under real-life crisis events. We then consider previous attempts in the academic literature to evaluate real and fabricated transportation networks. ## Identifying Critical Links on I-15 AEM worked with UDOT to put together a team of individuals to develop an I-15 Corridor Risk and Resilience (R&amp;R) Pilot in 2017. This project had a seven-step plan to understand the impact of physical threats to the Utah transportation network, specifically looking at two sections along I-15. These steps include asset characterization, threat characterization, consequence analysis, vulnerability assessment, threat assessment, risk/resilience assessment, and risk/resilience management. From these steps AEM was able to provide recommendations to UDOT that would improve resiliency along the corridor based on the criticality of each segment at risk. For the purpose of our study it is important to understand which threats AEM decided to analyze. In order for the team to identify which threats to consider they needed to use data that was available to them. They also ruled out certain threats based on their relevance. In the end AEM considered nine physical threats which include: earthquake, flood (scour), flood (overtopping/debris), fire (wildland), railway-proximity, oil/gas/water pipeline-proximity, and water canal/ditch-proximity. Then the available threat layers were intersected with assets (roadway, bridge, etc.), and if threat layers weren’t available historical data was analyzed to determine their annual probability. Once these threat layers were determined and the location of the threat-asset pairs along I-15 were found, AEM could then continue their analysis. This consisted of: gathering characteristic data for each asset (length, width, depth, condition, etc.), determining a replacement cost for each asset, establishing an estimated service life for each asset, estimating (if not known) the design standard for each asset, establishing which magnitudes of each threat were to be analyzed, and gathering information on the likelihood of occurrence of each magnitude of each threat. These steps are further described in their paper using multiple different threat locations. The AEM R&amp;R report provides a good template going forward for identifying links at risk, following the first definition of a resilient transportation network. The report also attempts to identify which links at risk are most critical, assessing a “criticality” score to the network based on the five data elements and categories given in Table 1. A key observation of these criticality scores is that they do not accommodate alternate routes that the traffic could use were the link to become unavailable. In identifying the systemic resiliency of highway facilities – as implied by the third definition of resiliency – requires considering these alternate routes. Table 1.

These events are the collapse of the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the I-85 / Piedmont Road fire and bridge collapse in Atlanta, Georgia. I-35 W Bridge Collapse On August 1, 2007, the I-35 bridge over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis collapsed during rush hour. The bridge, which was undergoing maintenance, had been rated as structurally deficient and fracture critical, meaning that failure of one member would cause structure failure. The collapse occurred during rush hour traffic, and the bridge was additionally loaded with approximately 300 tons of maintenance equipment (Schaper, 2017). There were 13 fatalities, approximately 140 injuries, and abrupt disruption to roughly 140,000 average daily trips (ADT) over the bridge (Zhu et al., 2010). The complicated nature of the demolition and repair meant this systemically critical link would be missing for approximately 14 months. The approximate location of the bridge, one of two major routes over the Mississippi River, can be seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Location of I-35 W bridge in Minneapolis (Imagery OpenStreetMap). Zhu et al. (2010) conduct a travel survey to provide a more in-depth analysis of important data and traffic changes surrounding the I-35W bridge collapse in 2007. The article uses a methodology that attempts to identify mode-choice and other behavioral changes of survey respondents. The authors analyze data looking for variations in ADT, as well as Origin-Destination matrices. Importantly, they analyze some pre-disaster data in their work. The authors provide evidence which indicates that drivers are reluctant to make mode choice changes, rarely doing so. This is likely due to reasons such as finances, time, or perceived difficulty of navigating a new mode of transport. At the same time, some drivers change destinations when faced with increased travel times. Levinson and Zhu (2010) explore traffic behavior and changes in the wake of major network disruptions such as those that occurred in Minnesota. The authors identify unique behavior post disaster using GPS tracking data, survey data from the post disaster phase, and other aggregate data from surrounding freeways and traffic devices. The gathered data was analyzed to track changes in ADT over bridges and alternative routes in the area after the disaster as well as after mitigation was complete. Levinson and Zhu provide increased understanding about how a network’s operability changes during a post-crisis environment. Xie and Levinson (2011) attempt to determine economic costs in the form of increased travel time of the 2007 I-35W bridge collapse using a scaled down travel demand model. The authors used a simplified version of the SONG 2.0 travel demand model that had been developed for the Twin Cities area to determine vehicle hours traveled (VHT) and vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT). They also calculate the accessibility for each zone from jobs to workers, and from workers to jobs of the network using employment, residency, and transportation cost data. Using this simplified travel model, the authors estimate that the bridge collapse cost the Twin Cities approximately $75,000/day in increased travel times. I-85 / Piedmont Road Bridge Fire In Atlanta, Georgia, a section of an I-85 bridge collapsed due to a massive fire under the bridge on March 30, 2017. The fire, which was started by a homeless man, grew quickly because of improperly stored construction materials under the bridge. The approximate location of the bridge collapse caused by the fire can be seen in Figure 2; the damaged link is at a critical point downstream of a merge point between two expressway facilities (GA-400 and I-85) bringing commuter traffic in from the suburbs of northern Fulton and Gwinnett Counties. Figure 2. Location of I-85 / Piedmont Road bridge in Atlanta (Imagery OpenStreetMap). As a result of the fire, the highway, which had an average daily traffic count (ADT) of 243,000, was closed in both directions for a period of about two months. This closure led to a 30% increase in traffic volumes across the entire downtown network, with increased congestion on side streets (Hamedi et al. 2018). Additionally, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), experienced a 20% increase in ridership, likely because many commuters made mode choice and route changes. To mitigate this, headways between busses and trains were decreased to allow greater passenger volume. MARTA was able to add 142,000 rail miles, 1,100 train hours, 8,202 bus miles, 512 bus hours, and 2,463 parking spaces in park and ride lots to help further mitigate the situation (MARTA 2017, MARTA 2018). It is likely that MARTA’s efforts to mitigate passenger volumes greatly influenced the onset of negative effects of the bridge fire. The section of I-85 that was closed impacted a large, upper income demographic in the greater Atlanta area who commuted across the bridge. This area was drastically impacted by the disaster. As a result, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) along with the Governor created a $3.1 million incentive program to help motivate project completion ahead of schedule. The bridge was originally set to be closed for a period of 10 weeks, however, it re-opened after just 6 weeks, with construction being completed a month ahead of schedule. The accelerated finishing date was estimated to have saved approximately $27 million in user and travel time costs (Georgia Department of Transportation, 2017). GDOT’s efforts to open the bridge quickly after its collapse aided in abating negative user costs due to significant travel time delays that surfaced due to changes in route choice and assignment. Attempts to Evaluate Systemic Resiliency A number of researchers have conducted studies where they construct real or fabricated transportation networks, eliminate or degrade links in the network, and evaluate the changes the loss of these links introduced into some measure of network performance. Berdica (2002) attempts to identify, define and conceptualize vulnerability by envisioning analyses conducted with several vulnerability performance measures including travel time, delay, congestion, serviceability and accessibility. Here, Berdica defines accessibility as the ability for users to travel between origins and destinations for any number of reasons. She then uses the performance measures to define vulnerability as the level of reduced accessibility due to unfavorable operating conditions on the network. In particular, Berdica identifies a need for further research toward developing a framework capable of investigating reliability of transportation networks. In this section we will examine several attempts by numerous researchers to do precisely this using different measures of network performance. A consolidation of this discussion is summarized in Table 2, namely the methods that different researchers have used in examining network performance under duress. The measures can be consolidated in to three basic families: Network Connectivity considers how isolated nodes of a network become when links are damaged. Travel Time analysis considers how removing or degrading a link affects the shortest cost paths between network points. Accessibility analysis considers how the population using the network has their daily patterns affected by the damaged network. We discuss studies within each family in turn. Table 2.

Accessibility (gravity) 2017 Ganin et al. Accessibility (gravity) 2019 Vodak et al. Network connectivity 2019 Hackl and Adey Network connectivity ##Network Connectivity Graph theory is the mathematical study of networks of nodes connected by edges (links). Within this discipline are the related concepts of network vulnerability and connectivity that have been accessed by researchers. In these studies, researchers tend to define critical links as those that connect to many other nodes (directly or indirectly), or as links whose loss isolates a number of nodes from the rest of the network. Abdel-Rahim et al., (2007) explores multi-layered graph theory to attempt to asses transportation network criticality. The researchers develop a weighting scheme based on interconnectedness between three layers of the transportation system: the power, communication, and physical road networks. This scheme is applied to and combined with data gathered using an Origin-destination matrix to determine criticality of road network facilities based on several proximity and link and node volume criteria. Abdel-Rahim et al. attempts to determine resilience through resistance by identifying a metric for examining the interrelatedness of the three systems, all of which are vital to proper function of the transportation network. Their methodology highlights some of the advantages to using a multi-layered graph approach for determining levels of resiliency of transportation networks. Agarwal et al., (2011), utilizes a systems approach to identify vulnerabilities based on connectivity. Their methodology uses a graph model to determine a hierarchical representation of a transportation network that could be analyzed for vulnerabilities. To do this, several concepts surrounding vulnerability are defined, including robustness and risk. Agarwal also outlines three criteria to help determine how facility failure affects a system. These were: form of the system, level of demand of the system, and level of systemic preparedness. These criteria provide a framework for network analysis that allows for identification of vulnerable scenarios and modification or adaption of involved facilities to be carried out. Agarwal’s framework best fits the definition of resilience through resistance due to the way it can identify critical facilities and allow for mitigation moving forward. Similarly, Ip and Wang (2011), attempt to combine graph theory with friability in order to determine criticality of links or hub cities. Friability is defined as the reduction of network capacity caused by removing a link or node. The methodology presented relies on the ability to determine the weighted sum of the resilience of all nodes based on the weighted average of connectedness with other city nodes in the network. The authors determine that the recovery of transportability between two cities largely depends on redundant links between nodes. Ip and Wang also comment that most traffic managers are more concerned with the friability of single links rather than the friability of multiple links or an entire system. The author’s hypothesis closely matches resilience through operability because the methodology seeks to determine resilience of a network that already has damaged links and nodes. Their main contribution to the field of transportation research is the idea of friability, that a network can break down for any number of reasons, of which transportation networks generally appear most susceptible to attack or disaster. Another researcher uses graph theory to approach the optimization of transportation systems. Guze (2015) conducts a review of the known uses of graph theory before reviewing several other multi-criteria optimization methods. Guze’s methodology as it relates to resiliency involves an analysis of the knapsack problem, however Guze tends to focus on flow theory in transportation systems as the best graph related analysis option. Graph theory is also useful for identifying shortest path, network connectivity, and other methods of network optimization. Graph theory supports the idea of resilience through recovery as well as operability because of how it represents networks with links and nodes, and its ability to identify next shortest paths in the case of disaster. Guze’s greatest contribution to transportation research is a simplified method for determining shortest path route options. Osei-Asamoah and Lownes (2014) adopt a network analysis methodology that is able to analyze resilience using the form of transportation networks like highways and railroads. In this article, the authors evaluate resilience by comparing the biological network of a common mold with a rail network. The author’s methodology uses two metrics to analyze network performance under disruption, namely global efficiency and the size of the giant component, or connected components containing any number of a graph’s vertices. To damage the network and reduce connectivity, individual links are cut. The efficiency of the graph is then measured using the inverse of the shortest path while the giant component used to measure the ratio of link connections after disaster to those existing before disaster. The authors ultimately conclude that web like structures with built in redundancies are better equipped to handle the increased pressures of network disruption. This claim is based on the fact that the biological mold network outperformed the physical networks in both tested scenarios. Zhang et al. (2015) investigates the role of network topology, meaning the layout of the network. The authors provide several examples of network topology types including hub and spoke, grid, and ring networks. After computing resilience indexes, or general resilience levels of each type of network topology, Zhang determines that metrics such as throughput, connectivity and average reciprocal distance increase with greater linage, however they decrease as networks become larger. This is likely because larger networks are sparser, having fewer node connections, and therefore are less redundant. Allowing for preparedness measures helped increase levels of resiliency. The authors greatest contribution appears to be increased understanding of the role network size and type plays in determining resiliency. Understanding how interconnectedness increases or decreases resiliency is vital to traffic managers. Hackl and Adey (2019) show the abilities of a Networks in Networks (NIN) approach, where nodes in a network represent other networks. Their methodology allows multiple types of data including topology, paths, and origin-destination data to be loaded into the same graph style network. The researchers prepare an example NIN with four layers. The NIN is able to effectively demonstrate changes to traffic flow. Some are unable to occur due to interrupted edges on the network. This form of network representation is effective for simplifying highly connected networks. The contribution of NIN networks is highly interesting, and should be investigated further to help aid in the reduction of time needed to locate critical infrastructure on transportation networks. Vodak et al. (2019) introduces a method to quickly identify critical links in a network by searching for the shortest cycles, or independent loops in the network. The algorithm progressively damages one or more links between iterations to determine if nodes become isolated, or cut off from the network. The authors use isolation as a measure of network vulnerability and connectedness. If a node becomes easily isolated or has a higher likelihood of becoming isolated, then there is a higher degree of vulnerability present in the network. Vodak’s work is significant because the novel algorithm is capable of processing upwards of 1000 links and nodes while effectively identifying vulnerabilities in the network. This ability makes the algorithm a valuable tool for resilience research at the regional and statewide levels ## Changes in Travel Time Graph theoretical approaches to resiliency largely consider whether the network nodes become isolated after links are degraded or removed. Though isolation is an important problem, transportation networks often have multiple redundant paths between nodes; however, some of these paths may be considerably longer. It is therefore useful to determine how the path cost changes even if the nodes involved are still reachable on the network. Peeta et al. (2010) constructs a model to evaluate the most efficient allocation of highway maintenance resources prior to an earthquake with the potential to disrupt transport network connectivity. The authors create a simplified graph of Istanbul, Turkey with 30 attributed links and 25 nodes, with each link having a specified failure probability that could be mitigated with investment. Using this graph, the researchers evaluate what happened to travel times between the origin-destination pairs as links from this network were disabled using a Monte Carlo simulation. The authors showed that this problem is tractable with a locally optimal solution existing. Serulle et al. (2011) refines the previous work of other researchers to define resiliency under pre-event conditions. The authors accomplish this by clarifying variables related to resiliency of transportation networks including average delay and transport cost, adjusting interactions, and increasing metric transparency. The authors employ a methodology capable of quantifying resiliency using a fuzzy interference approach – an approach meant to use imprecise or vague data – that relates physical and performance characteristics. The used approach is able to determine a resiliency index that supports comparative and sensitivity analyses. Accessibility data including available road capacity, road density, alternate route proximity, average delay, transport cost, and average speed reduction are analyzed for importance to the integrity of the network. Ibrahim (2011) provides an alternative heuristic approach for determining vulnerability of infrastructure by estimating the cost of single link failure based on the increase in shortest path travel time due to increased congestion levels. Ibrahim proposes a hybrid heuristic approach that calculates the traditional user-equilibrium assignment for finding the first set of costs, and then fixes those costs for all following iterations to determine the effects of failure on overall travel time of the system. Ibrahim’s novel heuristic approach is important because of its ability to drastically reduce computation time for larger networks while providing accurate results that closely match results found from traditional modeling methods. Omer et al. (2013) proposes a methodology for assessing the resiliency of physical infrastructure during disruptions. To do this, the authors use a network model to build an origin-destination matrix that allows initial network loading and analysis. Omer’s model uses several metrics, but the main metric used to determine resiliency is the difference in travel time between a disturbed and undisturbed network. Omer’s framework is applied to an actual network between New York City and Boston for analysis. Changes in demand, travel time, mode choice and route choice are tracked for analysis. Omer’s framework supports operability of transportation networks due to the way it analyzes networks experiencing suboptimal circumstances. The authors work identifies key parameters that should be measured to assess resiliency during disruptive events. Jaller et al. (2015) seeks to identify critical infrastructure based on increased travel time, or reduced capacity due to disaster. The proposed methodology utilizes user-equilibrium to determine proper initial network loading. Then, the shortest path between one origin and one destination can be identified. To implement damage to the network, a link is cut, and then the next shortest path is found. This process is followed for all links in the system in order to determine a sense of the criticality of each link to network resiliency. The analysis is carried out for each O-D pair, and the nodes with greatest change in travel time are determined to be the most critical. Jaller’s methodology allows traffic managers to identify critical paths for mitigation purposes before the occurrence of disaster through careful analysis. Xu et al. (2015) develop network-based measures and computational methods to evaluate transportation network redundancy. This methodology uses two dimensions in the analysis: travel alternative diversity and network spare capacity, meaning the number of effective connections available for each O-D pair and the congestion effect/choice behavior of travelers. To create the analysis, the authors first construct a sub-network which only looks at efficient routes. Next, the method counts the number of efficient routes from the origin to all nodes, and then estimates the multi-modal network spare capacity. Each dimension helps evaluate the capacity of the network based on different scenarios. Xu’s method supports operability by evaluating the capacity of transportation networks using altered or damaged networks. ## Changes in Accessibility Accessibility refers to the ease with which individuals can reach the destinations that matter to them; this is an abstract idea but one that has been quantified in numerous ways. Dong et al., (2006) provides a helpful framework for understanding various quantitative definitions of accessibility that we will simplify here. The most elementary definition of accessibility is whether a destination is within an isochrone, or certain distance. This measure is often represented as a count, e.g., the number of jobs reachable from a particular location within thirty minutes travel time by a particular mode. Mathematically, A_i=∑_j▒〖X_j I_ij 〗,where {█(I_ij=1 if d_ij&lt;D@I_ij=0 if d_ij&gt;D)┤ where the accessibility A at point i is the sum of the all the jobs or other destinations X at other points j. I_ij is an indicator function equal to zero if the distance between the points d_ij is less than some asserted threshold (e.g., thirty minutes of travel time). By relaxing the assumption of a binary isochrone and instead using the distance directly, we can derive the so-called gravity model, A_i=∑_j▒〖X_j 〖f(d〗_ij)〗 where the function f(d_ij) is often a negative exponential with a calibrated impedance coefficient. An extension of the gravity model is to use the logsum term of a multinomial logit destination choice model, A_i=ln⁡∑_j▒〖β_d d_ij+X_j β〗 Where the parameters β are estimated from choice surveys or calibrated to observed data. The logsum term has numerous benefits outlined by Handy and Niemeier (1997) and Dong et al. (2007); namely, the measure is based in actual choice theory, and can include multiple destination types and travel times by multiple different modes. Accessibility measures of any kind are important in resiliency analysis because a damaged transport network will limit the ability of people to access the full variety of destinations they otherwise would. Guers and van Wee (2004) provide a review of accessibility measures such as those above up to 2004. Of the papers they reviewed, Vickerman (1974), Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1979), Geurs and Ritsema van Eck (2001) used isochrone type methods, Stewart (1947), Hansen (1959), Ingram (1971), and Vickerman (1971), and Anas (1983) used gravity, and Neuburger (1971), Leonardi (1987), Williams and Senior (1978), Koenig( 1980), Anas (1983), Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985), Sweet (1997), Niemier (1997), Handy and Niemier (1997), Levine (1998), and Miller (1999) used or suggested logsums. They highlight the importance of using person-based measures such as these in evaluating network vulnerability and resiliency. Taylor (2008) also examines accessibility as a way to analyze network vulnerabilities, mainly through logsum analysis. Taylor begins by explaining the concepts of vulnerability and accessibility, which further help to explain their interrelatedness and key distinctions. He then applies logsum analysis to provide a framework for solving problems of accessibility. Taylor’s method for identifying vulnerabilities involves modeling travel demand, network topology, capacity, and road geometry in a manner that closely resembles a graph network. He does make one key distinction between links and nodes, however. A Node is vulnerable if link loss to that node diminishes its accessibility, while a Link is critical if its loss significantly diminishes accessibility within the network. One drawback to Taylor’s methodology at this point, is that it is intended to be used after critical locations have been identified. Geurs et al. (2010) compare the benefits attributed to various climate change-mitigation land use and transport policies under two different evaluation metrics. Geurs directly compares a “rule of half (RoH)” calculation where the travel time reduction is distributed between existing and new travelers on a route with a mode choice logsum derived from utility theory. They argue that because the logsum is more comprehensive and inclusive of the full changes to travel demand, the additional benefits attributed to proposed projects are both more realistic and more economically favorable to climate change mitigation policies. They show this by evaluating the accessibility and travel time changes resulting from land use densification strategies in the national travel demand model for the Netherlands. Christian Winkler (2016) proposes a travel demand model that is valid for all networks, especially those with more than one constraint. Constraints, like mode choice, are typically used to determine trip distribution in a model. Winkler’s methodology utilizes an EVA model, or a model that uses production, distribution, and mode choice as inputs. The methodology shows that an EVA model can be used to help determine outputs for multi-constraint Multinomial Logit Models (MNL) to help determine consumer surplus. Logsums like Winkler’s also allow for consumer surplus, measured as utility, to be estimated across the transportation network being modeled. Ganin et al. (2017) attempts to investigate resiliency through a disruption of 5% of the roadways in 40 urban networks within the United States. The employed methodology determines that Salt Lake City has the most resilient transportation network while Washington D.C. has the least resilient. This determination is based on a comparison of the network after links are damaged versus before. The authors work three factors into each model, namely the proportionality coefficient, minimum speed, and vehicle size adjustment factors. These essentially account for differences in car-truck ratios, average speed, and average vehicle length. Using a gravity model—a model which accounts for attraction and distance between zones—the authors were able to estimate the average annual delay per commuter. They used this to determine network efficiency. Ganin noted that traffic delay times increase significantly as road segments are broken. The main benefit from this article is the use of a gravity model to determine ways in which accurate transportation models can be calculated. ## Summary The lessons learned from the events in Minneapolis and Atlanta demonstrate that when transportation networks are damaged or degraded by link failure, multiple changes result. Traffic diverts to other facilities and other modes, and some people make fundamental changes to their daily activity patterns, choosing new destinations or eliminating trips entirely. Numerous other researchers have identified methodologies to capture the effects, or at least the costs, of these potential changes in modeled crisis events. We are able to learn from these methodologies to create a methodology on a state-wide level. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??.
